The software requires 2 types of Visual C++ Redistributable. If they are not installed on a computer, then you get the "missing dll" error. The fix is easy. First, check if both redistributables are installed on a computer. If one ore both are missing, then download the missing ones and install them. They are:

Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Service Pack 1 Redistributable Package MFC Security Update
download from:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26999
(This one is likely missing from very new machines.)

Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015
download from:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145
(This one is likely missing from old machines.)
